## My Goal
My goal is to gain a solid understanding of the principles and techniques involved in building a 2D game using the JAVA programming language. As I embark on this journey, I aim to develop my programming skills and also create something exciting and engaging. Although I have many game ideas, I have always been unsure of how to bring them to life through programming. Therefore, my hope is that by the end of this process, I will have the knowledge and skills necessary to build my own fully-functional 2D game from scratch.

## Acknowledgment
I would like to acknowledge RyiSnow as the creator of the 2D game tutorial that I will be following. RyiSnow's tutorial is an excellent resource for learning 2D game development in JAVA, as he provides clear and comprehensive explanations for each step of the process. I highly recommend checking out RyiSnow's channel at https://www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow if you are interested in learning more about this topic.
